REAP(1)                     General Commands Manual                    REAP(1)

NAME
     reap – run process until all its spawned processes are dead

SYNOPSIS
     reap [-vw] command line ...

DESCRIPTION
     The reap utility executes the given command line and ensures all spawned
     processes are dead before it exits.

     By default, it will start slaying the spawned processes when the main
     process exits.  When the option -w is given, reap will instead wait for
     the processes to terminate.

     Upon receiving SIGINT or SIGTERM, reap will start slaying all children
     immediately.

     The options are as follows:

     -w      Wait for all spawned processes to finish.

     -v      Verbose mode, report what reap is doing.

EXIT STATUS
     The reap utility exits with the exit status of the spawned command.

     On fatal errors, exit codes 111 is returned.

ASSUMPTIONS
     reap uses the PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER feature of Linux.  Slaying the
     children only works when the kernel configuration CONFIG_PROC_CHILDREN is
     enabled.

     reap can only work reliably when it has permission to kill all spawned
     processes and they respect SIGTERM.
